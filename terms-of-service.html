                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;"><i><b>The website and Services are offered on an &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; basis and subject to the following disclaimers and limitations.</b></i> We do not control or vet user-generated content on the site. We do not provide any express warranties or representations and disclaim any and all imputed warranties and representations, including all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, accuracy of data and noninfringement. We disclaim all liability for identity theft and other misuse of your identity or other content. We do not make any guarantees regarding the operation of the website and Services, portions or all of which may be unavailable at times or terminated permanently.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">Except as expressly provided in another contract between you and us, your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the website or Services is to terminate your account.

This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of whether you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory; we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages; or the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose.</p>

If you have a claim, you should send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent in Florida.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">The Florida Arbitration Act and Florida arbitration law applies to the Policies and your use of the Services. The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply to the arbitration, but we are not required to use such association to conduct the actual arbitration.

If for any reason a claim proceeds to a court, then we each waive any right we may have to a jury trial.</p>
